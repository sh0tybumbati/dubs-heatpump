		<description>Build advanced climate control systems that can both heat and cool using reversible refrigeration cycles. More efficient than separate heating and cooling systems.

Unlocks:
• Heat Pump Outdoor Unit - Reversible refrigeration compressor (250W, 120 capacity)
• Heat Pump Indoor Unit - Auto-switching temperature control (25W per unit)

Features:
• Automatic mode switching at ±2°C from target temperature
• Single outdoor unit supports multiple indoor units
• All units on same network operate in same mode (heating or cooling)
• More efficient than running separate heater + AC systems

Limitations:
• Heating disabled when outdoor temperature drops below -25°C (-13°F)
• Requires dedicated heat pump duct network (not compatible with regular AC ducts)
• Cannot mix heating and cooling modes on same outdoor unit

Ideal for: Year-round climate control with lower power consumption than traditional systems.</description>
